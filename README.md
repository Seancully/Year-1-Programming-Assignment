# Year-1-Programming-Assignment
 A program that allows a user to enter 6 numbers they select for the lotto. They are then given 6 options that each carry out
 a specific requirement.Each of these 6 different tasks is executed in different functions each having their own specific purpose where
 the program displays a simple menu where each option of this menu will call a different function that carries out one of the 6 tasks for 
 the user. The first option allows the user to enter their 6 lotto numbers 1-42 inclusive. The second option allows the user to display the
 6 lotto numbers they entered. The third option sorts the 6 lotto numbers into ascending order. The fourth option allows the user to compare
 their 6 lotto numbers to the winning lotto numbers and depending on the amount of matches they get shows their prize(s). The fifth option 
 allows the user to display the frequency of times the same lotto number is selected regardless of how many times a user inputs new lotto 
 numbers in the program. The last option allows the user to gracefully terminate the whole program. This program also contains all input
 validation that is necessary and pointer notation rather than subscript notation to access array elements.
